## 💻 Usage

### Create a new project

```bash

## 🎯 Problem It Solves

Setting up a backend project from scratch involves:
- ❌ Creating folder structure manually
- ❌ Installing and configuring dependencies
- ❌ Setting up database connections
- ❌ Configuring development environment
- ❌ 15-30 minutes of repetitive setup work

**create-jerry** reduces this to a single command! ✅

---

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

In your generated project:

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server with hot-reload
npm start        # Start production server
npm run build    # Compile TypeScript (TS projects only)
```
